SimpleCuda
==========

This program was created during my third year in SSU.

It geenrates 2 random matrices(1000x1000 size) and multiplies them using CUDA.

For multiplying I chose the simpliest algorithm - it makes n^3 multiplications, where n is the dimension.

This program was created to show the benefits of using CUDA instead of OpenMP library or just just parallel calculations.
